# git_hub_repo_test

To run this app type "npm i" in terminal, then type "npm start". The site will be hosted on http://localhost:3000/

 The main goal was to create an app that allow to search Github Repositories using Github API. 
It lists 10 most popular repos(sorted by stars) and some info about them. Without search request the app will display 10 most popular repos on Github. 
You can tap on one of 10 listed repos to display more info about the repo and its author. 

Thank you for cheaking my Github profile.

Best regards,
Ilia Popov
